#Rules of Inference
In logic a rule of inference is a logical form consisting of a fucntion which takes premises, analyzes their syntax and returns a conclusion or conclusions. 

##Symbols
> ~ = not
> ^ = and
> v = or
> --> = If then/Implies
> ∴ = Therefore

##Standard form of an Inference
1. antecedent 1 
2. antecedent 2 
3. ∴ consequent

> P --> Q
> P
>  ∴Q




##Modus Ponens
The **Law of detachment** (AKA **affirming the actecedent** and **modus ponens**) is the first form of deductive reasoning. It states that if a conditional statement is made, and a hypothesis is stated, then the conclusion is deduced from the statement and the hypothesis.

1. P --> Q (Conditional statement)
2. P (Hypothesis stated)
3. ∴ Q (Conclusion Deduced)

> All men are mortal
>    Socrates is a man
>    Therefore Socrates is mortal

###Common associated fallacy - Affirming the consequent 
Affirming the consequent (AKA **Converse Error**) is a formal fallacy of inferring the converse from the original statement.

1. P --> Q (Conditional statement)
2. Q 
3.  ∴ P

> If everyone was against me I'd have a bad day 
> I had a bad day 
> Therefore everyone is against me. 




##Modus Tollens
The law of **contrapositive** (AKA **Modus Tollens**) states that, in a conditional, if the conclusion is false, then the hypothesis must also be false.

1. P --> Q (Conditional statement) 
2. ~ Q (Not Q) 
3. ∴ ~ P (Not P)

> If it has a vagina then it is a woman
> Johns does not have a vagina
>  Therefore John is not a woman (Regardless of what he puts on his DEERS)

###Common associated fallacy - Denying the antecedent
AKA **Inverse Error** or **Fallacy of the inverse** is a formal fallacy of inferring the inverse from the original statement.

1. P --> Q
2. ~P 
3. ∴ ~Q

> If you run, you'll get sweaty 
> You didn't run
> Therefore you're not sweaty (What if I went biking?)



##Syllogism
The law of syllogism (AKA **The Chain Rule** ) takes two conditional statements and forms a conclusion by combining the hypothesis of one statement with the conclusion of another.

1. P --> Q
2. Q --> R
3. ∴ P --> R

>  If Jay doesn't study, he'll get bad grades
>  If Jay gets bad grades, he won't get to do his job
>  If Jay doesn't study, he won't get to do his job


##Conjunctive Addition
Conjunctive Addition is a rule of inference pertaining to the AND Operator. Conjunctive Addition means that any two true statements can be joined to form a conjunction. 

1. P
2. Q
3. ∴ P ^ Q

> The sky is blue
> The sun is out
> Therefore the sky is blue and the sun is out. 


##Demorgan's Law
Demorgan's law of inference is use to convert a negative to a conjunction or disjunction.

1. ~(P ^ Q)

> It is not true that I have a dog and a cat.

Demorgans law states that I can convert the above negative conjunction to the below:

2. ~P v ~Q

> I do not have a cat or I do not have a dog.

The above is an example of converting a negative conjunction into a disjuction alternatively we could use the same method to turn  a negative disjunction into a conjunction:

1. ~(P v Q)

> It is not true that Will Ferral is funny or step brothers was a great movie.

2. ~P ^ ~Q

> Will Ferral is not funny and step brothers was not a great movie.


##Disjunctive Addition
Disjunctive Addition is of inference which uses the OR operator. It adds any statement, whether true or false, to a true statement.
For example given the true statement:

1. P
2. P v Q

> Carbs are delicious
> Carbs are delicious or cocaine is a hell of a drug.

The above statement is true regardless of what Q is because P is True and we are using the OR operator.

##Disjunctive Inference
Disjunctive Inference (AKA The Process of Elimination) is another rule pertaining to the OR operator, which states that in a disjunction, if one of the disjuncts is false, then the other has to be true.

1. P v Q
2. ~Q
3. ∴ P

> Either your an asshole or you're just hungry.
> You're not hungry
> Therefore you're just an asshole
