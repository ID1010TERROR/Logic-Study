#Rules of Inference
In logic a rule of inference is a logical form consisting of a fucntion which takes premises, analyzes their syntax and returns a conclusion or conclusions. 

##Symbols
> ~ = not
> ^ = and
> v = or
> --> = If then/Implies
> ∴ = Therefore

##Standard form of an Inference
1. antecedent 1 

> P --> Q

2. antecedent 2 

> P

3. ∴ consequent

>  ∴Q




##Modus Ponens
The **Law of detachment** (AKA **affirming the actecedent** and **modus ponens**) is the first form of deductive reasoning. It states that if a conditional statement is made, and a hypothesis is stated, then the conclusion is deduced from the statement and the hypothesis.

1. P --> Q (Conditional statement)

> All men are mortal

2. P (Hypothesis stated)

>    Socrates is a man

3. ∴ Q (Conclusion Deduced)

>    Therefore Socrates is mortal

###Common associated fallacy - Affirming the consequent 
Affirming the consequent (AKA **Converse Error**) is a formal fallacy of inferring the converse from the original statement.

1. P --> Q (Conditional statement)

> If everyone was against me I'd have a bad day 

2. Q 

> I had a bad day 

3.  ∴ P

> Therefore everyone is against me. 




##Modus Tollens
The law of **contrapositive** (AKA **Modus Tollens**) states that, in a conditional, if the conclusion is false, then the hypothesis must also be false.

1. P --> Q (Conditional statement) 

> If it has a vagina then it is a woman

2. ~ Q (Not Q) 

> Johns does not have a vagina

3. ∴ ~ P (Not P)

>  Therefore John is not a woman (Regardless of what he puts on his DEERS)

###Common associated fallacy - Denying the antecedent
AKA **Inverse Error** or **Fallacy of the inverse** is a formal fallacy of inferring the inverse from the original statement.

1. P --> Q

> If you run, you'll get sweaty 

2. ~P 

> You didn't run

3. ∴ ~Q

> Therefore you're not sweaty (What if I went biking?)



##Syllogism
The law of syllogism takes two conditional statements and forms a conclusion by combining the hypothesis of one statement with the conclusion of another.

1. P --> Q

>  If Jay doesn't study, he'll get bad grades

2. Q --> R

>  If Jay gets bad grades, he won't get to do his job

3. ∴ P --> R

>  If Jay doesn't study, he won't get to do his job
